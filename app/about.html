            <p>I am a neuroscience researcher, aspiring roboticist and engineer, amateur designer, occasional gamer, and avid baker.</p>
            <p>I recently graduated from Northeastern University with a Bachelor of Science in Behavioral Neuroscience and a minor in Computer Science. In the fall, I will begin a MRes in Bioengineering at Imperial College London as a Marshall Scholar.</p>
            <p>I fully expect any given person to ignore at least 50% of what I post here. If you're interested in what I'm up to in the UK, chances are that you probably don't about how to install the font libraries for LabView in Linux or the role of big data in current biology research.</p>
            <p>Find out more about me on my website: <a href="http://juliaebert.com">juliaebert.com</a>.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or particularly delicious recipes, <a href="mailto:julia@juliaebert.com">send me an email</a>.</p>
